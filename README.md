# ESP8266-WiFi-Home-Energy-Monitoring-with-Solar
A low cost way to measure real power consumption and generation using the ESP8266 12E
<p>This set up uses 2-ADS1015 modules from Adafruit and the onboard ADC with 3 CTs.  Also samples the voltage via a resistor network.</p>
<p>I'm able get 49 sample points per 60 Hz </p>
<p>Developed using the Arduino IDE and ESP8266 board manager v2.2.0.  v2.3.0 is not compatible for some unknown reason</p>
